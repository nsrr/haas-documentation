# About

The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study of Sleep Apnea (HAASSA) was conducted to assess sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in an elderly cohort of Japanese-American men under surveillance for Alzheimer disease (AD) and other dementias. Subjects had unattended overnight polysomnography (PSG) conducted in their home according to criteria established previously for the large multicenter [Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs). The protocol (conducted in 1999-2000) was added to the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS), a longitudinal study of AD and other aspects of brain aging among surviving participants of the Honolulu Heart Program (HHP). More than 700 men aged 79 years and older were screened for dementia and received overnight PSG during the course of the 1999-2000 examination. These cross-sectional data were used to assess possible relationships between SDB and cognitive performance in late life.
